## Installing golang binary
Go to golang [page](https://golang.org/dl/) and download the binary for your os.

To check if the installation is complete,
run: 
```
which go
> /usr/local/go/bin/go
go
> # should show the help options
```

If using VSCode then install the [go extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go). Create a new file, set it as type Go and then install Analysis tools by clicking the notification popup on the bottom of vscode.
